# 🧹 Data Cleaning, Visualization & Modeling  
In this project, we performed **data cleaning, exploratory visualizations, and basic modeling** on the Olympic dataset.

## 📌 Overview
This notebook covers the full preprocessing pipeline, including:
### 🧼 1. Data Cleaning
- Handling missing values  
- Detecting and treating outliers  
- Fixing inconsistent or incorrect entries  
- Converting data types  
- Preparing data for further analysis  

### 📊 2. Data Visualization
- Exploratory visualizations for better understanding the dataset  
- Distribution plots, correlation analysis, and trend exploration  
- Visual insights to guide modeling decisions  

### 🤖 3. Modeling
- Preparing features for modeling  
- Training simple baseline models  
- Evaluating model performance  
- Understanding key factors impacting predictions
